BESA is a voluntary, non-profit organisation, which aims to provide support to British Embassy and Government exchange personnel posted to the USA, and those who accompany them. Our sincere wish is to welcome and get to know new members, provide relevant information and on-going social support through BESA sponsored groups and activities. BESA also donates to agreed charitable organisations.
​
If you are a new arrival, welcome to America! We are here to help you enjoy the opportunities offered by a Washington posting by bringing together the communities represented at the British Embassy.  

If you would like to be a member, you can sign up using this [link](https://eepurl.us20.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=e63e7bfcb175c8e846feb3b8f&id=846ac7dc01) or you can get in touch via our BESA Team page. There is no cost involved in being part of BESA and no obligations to attend any of the events but it’s a great way of getting to know people, make friends, and share information.

Best wishes from the BESA Community.
